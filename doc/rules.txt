RULES: Joust-style
----------------------------------------

If a flier lands ON TOP of another, the lower flier is KILLED.
If fliers run into each other HEAD-ON, they BOUNCE away from each other.

A flier can DASH to KILL another from ANY direction, but if they miss, they become DAZED.

A flier can SWIPE to KILL another flier HEAD-ON.

A flier can BLOCK both SWIPES and DASHES, and the attacker becomes DAZED.

A DAZED flier cannot BLOCK NOR DASH, and can be KILLED from ANY direction

Block has a cooldown; dashing's cooldown is daze; swipe has virtually no cooldown.
